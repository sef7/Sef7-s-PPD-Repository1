# Sef7-s-PPD-Repository1
Just a test repository for working out how to use GitHub.

these are some of the things that I discovered when using GitHub:

-Help facility is not always clear/bit confusing for biginers.

-Can leave comments when you make a change to a file

-Can either install comand line based software git or use the online facility github
